# HTML5 Notes

## Structure
* sections followed by headings define outline
* heading followed by heading creates implicit section including the second heading
* blockquote, details, fieldset, figure, and td are all sectioning roots and headings inside of them are not included in the outline
* aside and nav (can have multiples) are not included in outline
* header and footer tags can represent the header and footer of any/all sections
